[10.40AM] Met with group and got caught up on their previous
		  progress. Program 4 work was divided up and my
		  contribution would be to finish the Echo function.
[11.10AM] Started to work on the Echo function.
[11.40AM] Finished setting up the general structure for the 
		  Echo function.

--------[11/11/2013]--------
[09.40AM] Started to work on the Echo function again.
[10.20AM] Made significant progress on the Echo function. Was
		  able to get the function set up for checking the input 
		  strings for any symbols.
[10.30AM] Met with group again to see where everyone's progrress
		  was. After discussing, I decided to write the Line 
		  Extension function as well as comparing the files in 
		  the repository with my current files and making sure
		  none of the files are overwritten by any commits. It's
		  basically making sure the files are kept up-to-date for
		  everyone.
[11.20AM] The Echo function now successfully checks for the '@' 
		  character and displays the content of the environment 
		  variable that was entered.

[10.00AM] Continued work on the Echo function.
[10.20AM] Thought I got the Line extension working (within the Echo 
		  function), but I misunderstood what the Line extension was 
		  really supposed to do. Undid all the Line extension coding
		  to put it in a separate function with custom coding for a
		  special user input.
[11.30AM] Was able to get the Line extension function working. It checks
		  all lines of the original user input (including the first
		  partition) and disregards anything entered in after the '$'
		  character. I also made the inputting of the second line a bit
		  more intuitive. It should be strongly implied to the user that
		  the second line is for additional input.
[11.32AM] Was able to break the LineExtension by using
		  "echo testing$tryingtobreak". Returned a "Command
		  not found." error.
[12.15PM] False alarm. Just now figured out it was breaking because the 
		  string length was longer than is supported. There seems to be no
		  issues with the Line extension function.
